# Call - Call Procedure 

* CALL's job is to transfer control to a different funciton;
in a way that control can later be resumed where it left off
* First it pushes the address of the next instruction onto the stack
    * For use by RET for when the procedure is done 
* Then it changes RIP to the address given in the instruction 

* Destination address for the target function can be specified in multiple ways 
    * Absolute address 
    * Relative address (relative to teh end of the instruction,or some other register)

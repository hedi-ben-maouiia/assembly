#ADD and #SUB 

* Adds or Subtracts, just as expected 
* Destination operand can be r/mX or register 
* Source operand can be r/mX or register or immediate 
* No source and destination as r/mXs, because that could allow
for memory to memory to memory transfer, which isn't allowed on x86 


* add rsp, 8 -> (rsp = rsp + 8)
* sub rax, [rbx*2] -> (rax = rax = memorypointedtoby(rbx*2))

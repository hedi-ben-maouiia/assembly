# How to read two-operand instructions:

    Intel Vs AT&T Syntax

* Intel: Destination <- Source(s)

    - Windows. Think algebra or C: y = 2x + 1;
    - mov rbp, rsp
    - add rsp, 0x14 ; (rsp = rsp + 0x14)
* AT&T: Source(s) -> Destination 
    - *nic/GNU. Think elementary school: 1+2 = 3 
    - mov %rsp, %rbp
    - add $0x14, %rsp 
    - So registers get a % prefix and immediates get a $ 
* My classes will prefer Intel syntax 
* It's important to know both, so you can read documents in either format
